# Problem Statement : Add Evens

Write a program with a recursive method called addEvens that returns the sum of the given first “n” even integers. ​

For example,

***addEvens(1)  must return 0***
***addEvens(9) must return 20***
***addEvens(-9) must return 0***

## Tasks
1. The class AddEven consists of one recursive method to calculate the sum of even numbers.
**public long addEvens(int n)**
This method takes a positive integer ‘n’ as input and finds the sum of all the even numbers up to the given number ‘n’ ​
For example, if input is 9, the even numbers till 9 are summed up 2+4+6+8 = 20
2. In the main method, call the addEvens method and print the sum of even numbers.
3. Execute all the test cases provided in the test folder.
