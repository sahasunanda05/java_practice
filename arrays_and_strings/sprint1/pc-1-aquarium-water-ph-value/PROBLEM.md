 ### Practice Challenge - Aquarium Water pH Value

#### The chemical formula of water is H2O (2 hydrogen atoms + 1 oxygen atom). The term pH is a measure of the hydrogen concentration in water. The pH value ranges from 0-14, with 0 being the most acidic and 14 the most alkaline (basic). Neutral water has a pH of 7. ​

#### For a goldfish to survive in an aquarium, pH must range from 7-8. The pH value of an aquarium may change from time to time. 

### Write test cases for the solution provided.

#### Create the test cases in the PhLevelAnalyserTest class created in the test packag​

#### Below are the task 
##### 1. Initialize the object of the PhLevelAnalyser class in the setUp() method, that will be called before the execution of every test case.​

##### 2. Set the object of PhLevelAnalyser class initialized in setup method to null in the tearDown() method, this will be called after execution of every test case.​

##### 3. Create the following test cases in the PhLevelAnalyserTest class created in the test package.​

    public void getPhValueOfWaterForInputPhSeven(){}

    public void getPhValueOfWaterForInputPhEight(){}

    public void getPhValueOfWaterForInputPhTen(){}
