### Practice Challenge  - Reverse Digits 

#### Ron and Steve are playing a reverse number game where one gives an integer to the other and the person receiving the integer reverses the number and displays the output.

#### If either of them fails to reverse the number, the game ends.

### Write test cases for the solution provided.

#### Below are the task 

##### 1. Create the test cases in the ReverseDigitTest class created in the test package.​

##### 2. Initialize the object of the ReverseDigit class in the setUp() method, that will be called before the execution of every test case.​

##### 3. Set the object of ReverseDigit class initialized in the setup method to null in the tearDown()method, this will be called after execution of every test case.​

##### 4. Create the below test cases in the ReverseDigitTest class created in the test package.

    public void givenInputPositiveNumberReverseTheDigit(){}

    public void givenInputNegativeNumberReverseTheDigit(){}
